## Visual QA

For any change that can affect a rendered interface, inspect the real application (not a demo route) on the rebuilt instance in a browser at representative wide, medium, and narrow sizes, including the wide-to-narrow-to-wide transition, before completing the ticket. Exercise the affected states and transitions, then review readability, clipping and overflow, alignment, spacing, typography, contrast, icons, responsive behavior, and consistency with adjacent components. Fix defects, rerun affected behavioral checks, and inspect the corrected result. DOM, accessibility, style, and geometry assertions support this review but do not replace looking at the rendered page. A capture that shows a visible defect is never correctness evidence; fix, rerun, and recapture before attaching.

If the ticket has a problem or design image, capture the corresponding after state at the same component and viewport as closely as practical. Attach the image to the ticket and name it in the completion note. Screenshots supplement behavioral tests. If browser capture or attachment is unavailable after practical attempts, describe the exact blocker and leave the visual ticket open for review rather than claiming visual validation.
