## Requirements Documentation

Keep human-readable requirements as the source of truth for product behavior. Update them in the same change that adds, removes, or changes behavior. Create and cross-link documents for major new functional areas.

Maintain two concise AI-readable synthesis documents at project-specific, repository-relative locations:

- A codebase map of directory structure, entry points, schema, settings, build and test paths, and where to find important behavior. Update it when structure or contracts change.
- A requirements summary covering each requirements document and marking what is shipped, partial, design-only, or deferred. Update it when requirements or implementation status change.

If either document is absent, create a minimal, truthful version in the same change that first needs it; link it from the project's documentation index and record its relative path in local `hotsheet:specifics` guidance. Setup and refresh install these instructions but do not invent a map or product status. Preserve any existing document locations and prefer targeted updates over rewrites. Source requirements documents and code win if a summary conflicts with them.
